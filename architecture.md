Initial startup (Do you have a file or not with the agent?)

If you have a file
Continue with the lessons
Else:
Create a file

File creation:
The agent asks several questions to determine the skill level and interests of the user - these are saved in a file the agent will leverage in the future

Main-loop:
Agent proposes some directions for the user(Lesson, Plan, Test, Ponder new topics, Research) Each path is it's own subagent.
Users moves in desired direction with subagent

Pieces required are a router, subagents, and a memory system.

### **Initial Assessment: Understanding Your Profile**

1.  **Your Current Stage:** What is your current academic or professional background?

    - A) High school student planning for college.
    - B) University student (and if so, what is your major and year?).
    - C) A recent graduate.
    - D) A working professional in a tech role (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Analyst).
    - E) A working professional looking to transition from a non-tech field.
    - F) Other (please specify).

2.  **Educational Path:** Are you currently enrolled in a formal degree program (e.g., Computer Science, Data Science), or are you planning to learn primarily through online courses, bootcamps, and certifications?

3.  **Technical Foundation:** How would you rate your proficiency in the following areas (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)?

    - **Programming:** (e.g., Python, which is key for AI/ML)
    - **Mathematics:** (Specifically Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability & Statistics)
    - **Cloud Computing:** (Any experience with AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure?)
    - **Basic Machine Learning Concepts:** (e.g., What are training/testing sets, regression, classification?)

4.  **Specific Interests in Gen AI:** What aspects of Generative AI are you most fascinated by?

    - Large Language Models (LLMs) and natural language processing (e.g., chatbots, text summarization).
    - Image and video generation (e.g., Midjourney, Stable Diffusion).
    - Code generation and developer tools.
    - The underlying architecture and ethics of these models.

5.  **Timeline and Commitment:** How much time can you realistically dedicate to this plan each week? And what is your target timeline for feeling "job-ready"? (e.g., 6 months, 1-2 years, etc.)

6.  **Perceived Challenges:** Are there any specific challenges you anticipate or areas where you feel less confident (e.g., advanced mathematics, client-facing communication, complex coding)?
